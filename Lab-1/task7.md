# Task 7:
## 4.) The head command allows you to see the top part of a file. You may specify the number of lines you want, or default to ten lines. Use head to display the first 5 lines of ~/.bash_history. Write down the exact command you used.
```
(base) ➜  ~ head -n 5 ~/.bash_history
sudo apt install plank
sudo apt-get install plank
sudo apt remove gnome-shell-extension-ubuntu-dock 
restart now
shutdown now
```

## 5.) 5. The tail command works like head, except that it shows the last lines of a file. Use tail to display the last 10 lines of ~/.bash_history. Write down the exact command you used. 
```
(base) ➜  ~ tail -n 10 ~/.bash_history
exit
chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh blaine
exit
nvim test.tex
exit
ls
PS1='PEXPE\[\]CT_PROMPT>' PS2='PEXPE\[\]CT_PROMPT_' PROMPT_COMMAND=''
export TERM=dumb PAGER=cat
jupyter-notebook
exit
```
